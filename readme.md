An obsidian vault with minimal plugins, designed for newcomers. 

Get [obsidian from here](https://obsidian.md/).

Start it up, and explore the included 'help' vault to become familiar with the interface and concepts. Then, when you're ready, start using this vault.

When you open this vault for the first time, Obsidian will ask you if you want to turn safe mode off; say 'yes'. (There are one or two community plugins used; 'safe' mode disables community plugins. But these ones are ok.)
